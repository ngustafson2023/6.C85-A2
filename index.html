			<h2>Subtheme: Speculation</h2>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>What are the trends in house flipping activity across Boston from 2000 to 2023?</li>
				<ul>
					<li><em>Motivation:</em> The increasing trend of house flipping in Boston and its impact on the housing market, as highlighted in "Homes for Profit", motivated this question. This document illustrates the surge in investor activity and its correlation with housing affordability crises. It emphasizes the need to understand flipping trends and their broader implications on housing accessibility.</li>
					<li><em>Follow-Up:</em> Which neighborhoods have the highest incidence of house flipping?</li>
					<li><em>Follow-Up:</em> How long do properties typically stay in the possession of investors before being flipped?</li>
				</ul>

				<li>How has the profitability of house flipping changed over time?</li>
				<ul>
					<li><em>Motivation:</em> Insights drawn from "Homes for Profit" about the effects of house flipping on communities, particularly in neighborhoods with vulnerable populations, motivated this question. The report discusses how flipping activities correlate with rising housing prices and affect the availability of affordable housing, prompting a need to explore the profitability shifts of these real estate practices to anticipate community impacts.</li>
					<li><em>Follow-Up:</em> How much are properties selling for?</li>
					<li><em>Follow-Up:</em> What is the average profit margin on flipped houses, and how has this changed over time?</li>
				</ul>
				
				<li>How significant is the role of institutions in the Boston housing market?</li>
				<ul>
					<li><em>Motivation:</em> The article "When Private Equity Becomes Your Landlord" from ProPublica inspired this question. It sheds light on the growing role of large corporations and private equity firms in the housing market, altering the landscape of homeownership and rental markets. This trend raises concerns about the effects of corporate ownership on housing affordability and market dynamics, warranting an in-depth analysis.</li>
					<li><em>Follow-Up:</em> What proportion of residential sales is made to institutions versus individuals?</li>
					<li><em>Follow-Up:</em> How has corporate buying activity changed over time?</li>
				</ul>

			<h2>Discoveries & Insights</h2>

			<figure>
				<img src="Total of Sales by Zip Code.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				First, we begin a comprehensive analysis of the the shape and structure of our dataset. This visualization shows the number of residential sales in the City of Boston from
				2000 to 2023, broken down by zip code. Immediately, we see from our histogram that the strong majority of sales in our dataset occurred in just 10 zip codes.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="Total of Sales by Zip Code by Year.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				Next, we continue our analysis while addressing our first overall question. In this area chart, we can see how the total number of residential sales in the city vary year-by-year. Additionally,
				we can see how the distribution of sales amongst our ten most popular zip codes differ over time. We note that, interestingly, the relative proportions of area between zip codes remains somewhat constant, 
				while the number of sales peaked in 2004 and reached a low in 2020. 
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="Total of Sales by Building Type.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				Exploring new portions of our dataset, we analyze the types of buildings being sold. We see that over 44,000 sales consisted of condominiums, while just over 4,000 sales consisted of any 
				other type, including one- and two-family homes. This is valuable insight to keep in mind when drawing conclusions from other analyses based on this data. 
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="Histogram of Total Sales by Price.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				In this visualization, we take a high-level perspective to analyze the distribution of sale prices in our data. This histogram shows a right-skewed, unimodal distribution with a 
				peak around $400,000. Here, we encounter some interesting data quality questions. Notice that there is a significantly large number of sales with prices between $0 and $50,000. Additionally, 
				there seems to be a perpetual number of sales as price increases to the right. 
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="Total Sales by Flip Term.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				Now we begin to investigate our second overall question, studying trends in house flipping. In this bar chart, we see the breakdown of sales into four categories: non-flip, long-term flip, medium-term 
				flip, and short-term flip. Prominently, we notice that the vast majority in our dataset is identified as non-flips. 
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="Sale Profits by Flip Term.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				Filtering by exclusively long-term, medium-term, and short-term flips, we take a look at the profitability of sales in our data. From the box-and-whisker annotations, we see that the average profitability
				was close to $0M across all categories, with relatively small variances despite wide ranging values. This is somewhat surprising, and begs the question: how is house flipping activity changing
				over time?
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="Avg. Flip Horizon by Year.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				In this visualization, we see two line graphs. On the top, we see how the average time horizon (in months) of house flips has changed throughout the years. We see a dramatic rise from 
				2000 to 2007, a decline to 2010, and a relative plateau from 2012 to 2023. On the bottom, we are presented with the total volume of house flips per year. Here, we notice a plateau from 2000 
				to 2010, a dramatic rise to 2016, then a steady decline to 2023. 
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="Density Map of House Flips.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				Here, we are presented with a geographical map of Boston. On the map, there is an opaque dot at each instance of a house flip in our data. We immediately recongize that most of the home flips 
				exist in obvious clusters. Here, we ran into some data quality issues in the latitude and longitude values used to create this visualization. There exist some data points with lat/lon values of 0/0, or 1/1, or
				in the middle of the ocean. These values have been removed from the visualization.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="Pie Chart of Total Sales by Investor Type.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				Finally, we begin to explore our third overall question. This pie chart depicts the breakdown of residential sales in our dataset into four categories by purchaser: institutional investor, small investor,
				medium investor, large investor, and non-investor. We notice that around 2/3 of the sales in our data involve non-investor purchasers, or individuals. Similarly to before, this begs the question: how has
				this dynamic changed over time?
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="Sales of Investors and Individuals by Year.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				Lastly, we are presented with a line graph that showcase two plot-lines. First, we see the total number of sales made by non-investors per year in orange. Second, we see the total number of sales made 
				by investors (institutional, small, medium, and large) per year in blue. We see that investor purchases remain relatively constant over time, while non-investor purchases fluctuate more and steadily decline over time.

			<h2>Summary</h2>

			<p>In our analysis of residential sales data in the City of Boston from 2000 to 2023, we analyzed three main topics. First, we analyzed how aggregate residential sales changed over time, identifying sharp changes and maximums and minimums, 
				as well as how these sales were distributed amongst different neighborhoods. Second, we analyzed the profitability of house flipping in Boston, and even broke down the data by time horizon. Third, we took
				a magnifying glass to the dynamics between investor and individual purchases. These visualizations provide ample context to complement the on-going societal debates on how house-flipping and investor behavior
				might be contributing to the current housing crisis.
